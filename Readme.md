Rarbg.to TV Shows
===

A plugin for [Kodi mediacenter](www.kodi.tv) to watch ongoing US TV show torrents from *rarbg.to* site
dicrectly in Kodi without fully downloading them.
The plugin requires external [YATP](https://github.com/romanvm/kodi.yatp) (preferred)
or [Pulsar](https://github.com/steeve/plugin.video.pulsar) torrent-streaming plugins.

The plugin can be installed in Kodi from [my addon repository](https://github.com/romanvm/kodi_repo).

Since I've developed this plugin for my personal use, it is provided "as is".
